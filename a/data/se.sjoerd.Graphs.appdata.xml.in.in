      Graphs is a simple, yet powerful tool that allows you to plot and manipulate your data with ease. You can import data from two-column files or generate it via an equation. All data can be manipulated using a variety of operations such as the ability to select, cut, translate, multiply, center and smooth data, as well as apply any custom transformations using numpy notation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Graphs lets you customize the style of plotted data. You can add and edit stylesheets in detail.
    </p>
    <p>
      Graphs is an excellent fit for both plotting and data manipulation. The plots created with Graphs can be saved in a variety of formats suitable for sharing and presenting to a wide audience, such as in a scientific publication or presentations. It is also possible to save the plots as vector images, which can be easily edited in programs like Inkscape for further customization and refinement. Graphs is written with the GNOME environment in mind, but should be suitable for any other desktop environment as well.
